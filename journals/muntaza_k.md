It was mainly a production day, since the each individual in the team has a specific responsibility, we were able to focus working individually, however since most of the features are dependent on each other some of us had to wait, but not all of them has high priority. I was able to test them out locally after pulling josh  code, and it went well, I just need to make sure to update some of the table and check compatibility tomorrow.

Application planing phase completed today, as we were able to successfully divide roles among the team.
