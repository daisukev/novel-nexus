## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Collaborated as a group to discuss what pieces of our project should be prioritized before we continued to add more functionalities to each page of the project. Made migrations for database tables and tested out merge requests to the main.

Divided up the work within group to create issues for the various API endpoints. I was tasked with the endpoint to create/manage tables.

17 August 2023
Continued with implementing my backend API endpoint and merge requests with the group regarding these. Made sure that these were completed before starting class again on Monday. Ensured that checkpoint items for the week were completed.

21 August 2023
- Endpoints were pulled on each computer and made sure it was working for everyone.
- Designed and decided on the color scheme for our website as a group on Realtime Colors and started splitting up the frontend work.
- Decided which CSS framework we wanted to include, updating wireframe to match current needs, and organize the directories for the frontend.
- Had some trouble setting up the React on my end because the ghi container wasn’t running but got it fixed.

21-27 August 2023
Continued working to implement the landing page and submitted MR “Implement Landing Page” that contains components that connect to the sign up, sign in, and home page that is connected from “Browse Books” button.

28 August - 3 September 2023
Implemented the search functionality through both front and backend that allows users to search for a book through keywords.

3-10 September 2023
Implemented frontend genre tags and genre pages + backend genre endpoint based on genre type. Added GenresTag to display the genre tag accordingly (based on endpoint response) and created clickable genre tags that redirect the user to the pages that shows all books that have the same genre, and added endpoint to get books based on the genre. Genres was also added into the sidebar function.
Added a unit test (test_books.py).
